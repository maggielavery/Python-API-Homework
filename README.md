# Python-Weather-API
This is a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator utilizing citipy, and the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). 

I have built scatterplots to test the relationship between latitiude and temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.
